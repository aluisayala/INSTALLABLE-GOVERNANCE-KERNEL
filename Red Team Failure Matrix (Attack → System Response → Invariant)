Red Team Failure Matrix (Attack → System Response → Invariant)

This section is the trust converter.

It assumes a hostile or skeptical operator and answers one question only:

“If I try to break this, what exactly happens?”

Everything below is intentional behavior, not best-effort.

🔴 Red Team Failure Matrix

Each row represents a real attack or misuse scenario.
Each outcome is deterministic.

🧨 Attack Class 1: Parameter Manipulation
Attack	What the attacker does	System response	Invariant preserved
Alpha inflation	Sets alpha to extreme value	SE44 entropy violation → reject	No unstable Ω enters ledger
Bias spoofing	Changes bias without version increment	Hash mismatch → validator reject	Bias lineage is enforced
State type mismatch	Declares incorrect state type	Coherence drop → reject	Semantic integrity preserved

Key point:
Governance cannot be “tuned past” limits.

🧨 Attack Class 2: Continuity Attacks
Attack	What the attacker does	System response	Invariant preserved
Drift jump	Large Ω delta from last fossil	RMS drift violation → reject	Continuity enforced
History rewind	Attempts to compute against old Ω	Previous-hash mismatch → reject	Time moves forward only
Replay attack	Resubmits old valid emission	Hash collision detected → reject	Fossils are single-use

Key point:
Continuity is mechanical, not contextual.

🧨 Attack Class 3: Validator Attacks
Attack	What the attacker does	System response	Invariant preserved
Single-validator override	Disables secondary validator	No consensus → no write	No unilateral authority
Modified validator logic	Alters validator thresholds	Hash disagreement → reject	Fork is visible
Network desync	Causes validator delay or loss	Timeout → reject	Availability ≠ authority

Key point:
Validators can disagree safely — governance halts.

🧨 Attack Class 4: Ledger Attacks
Attack	What the attacker does	System response	Invariant preserved
Direct ledger edit	Modifies ledger file	Hash chain breaks → reject	History is immutable
Partial write	Interrupts append operation	Transaction aborted	No half-truths
Fake previous hash	Supplies forged hash	Integrity check fails	Chain continuity

Key point:
The ledger is dumb, strict, and final — by design.

🧨 Attack Class 5: Runtime Abuse
Attack	What the attacker does	System response	Invariant preserved
Infinite retries	Spams invalid emissions	Rate-limited, quarantined	No exhaustion of truth
Exception forcing	Tries to crash runtime	Process exits safely	No corrupted state
Privilege escalation	Gains container access	Read-only FS blocks writes	Runtime ≠ authority

Key point:
Crashing the runtime does not grant power.

🚫 Attacks That Are Impossible (By Construction)

These cannot occur unless the code is rewritten:

❌ Writing to ledger without validator agreement

❌ Overwriting a fossil

❌ Editing past records

❌ Accepting governance via role or identity

❌ Silently correcting invalid emissions

If any of these happen, the system is compromised, not misused.

🧠 Why This Matrix Matters

This matrix demonstrates that:

All failures are local

All authority is structural

All corruption attempts are observable

All forks are explicit

There is no “unknown failure mode” that grants power.

✅ Final Safety Guarantee

Every attack either fails cleanly or produces a visible fork.
No attack produces silent authority.

That is what safe failure means in governance.

📌 Adoption Test (Implicit)

If someone can:

clone the repo

run the demo

execute these attacks

and observe these outcomes

Then governance does not rely on trust.

It relies on execution.
