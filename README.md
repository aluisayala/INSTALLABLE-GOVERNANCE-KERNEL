# Installable Governance Kernel (IGK)

## What This Is

An installable governance kernel that enforces rules **by execution**, not policy.

Governance here is:
- deterministic
- auditable
- append-only
- safe under failure

If it runs, it governs.
If it fails, it fails safely.

---

## What This Is Not

- Not a DAO
- Not AI ethics
- Not a policy framework
- Not advisory governance
- Not permission-based authority

---

## One-Command Demo

```bash
docker compose up
./demo_fail_safely.sh
