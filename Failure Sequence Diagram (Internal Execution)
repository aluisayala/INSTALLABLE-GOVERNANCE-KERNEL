This is a mechanical sequence, not conceptual.
It shows exactly where failure can occur and what cannot happen.

You can drop this straight into the README.

🔁 Failure Sequence Diagram
Legend

KR = Kernel Runtime

SV = Secondary Validator

FL = Fossil Ledger

MS = Mutable Shell

🟢 Normal (Successful) Path — for reference
Client
  |
  v
KR: Execute Ω
  |
  v
KR: Generate Trace
  |
  v
KR: SE44 Validate (pass)
  |
  v
SV: Recompute Ω + Metrics

  v
SV: Hash Match (pass)

Key property:
Ledger write happens only after dual agreement.

❌ Failure Case A: SE44 Validation Failure

Cause: entropy / drift / coherence violation

Client
  |
  v
KR: Execute Ω
  |
  v
KR: Generate Trace
  |
  v
KR: SE44 Validate (FAIL)
  |
  +--------------------+
  |                    |
  v                    |
MS: Store Rejected     |
  |                    |
  v                    |
Client ← REJECTED      |
                       |
FL: (NO CALL) ◄────────+
SV: (NO CALL)

What this proves

Ledger is never contacted

Validator is never contacted

Failure is contained entirely inside runtime

History cannot change

❌ Failure Case B: Dual Validator Mismatch (SE44.1)

Cause: hash mismatch, recomputation difference, forced desync

Client
  |
  v
KR: Execute Ω
  |
  v
KR: Generate Trace
  |
  v
KR: SE44 Validate (pass)
  |
  v
SV: Recompute Ω + Metrics
  |
  v
SV: MISMATCH
  |
  +--------------------+
  |                    |
  v                    |
MS: Store Rejected     |
  |                    |
  v                    |
Client ← REJECTED      |
                       |
FL: (NO WRITE) ◄───────+

What this proves

Primary runtime cannot assert truth alone

Ledger enforces consensus-by-equality

Validator disagreement halts governance cleanly

❌ Failure Case C: Ledger Integrity Refusal

Cause: previous hash mismatch, tampering, malformed entry

Client
  |
  v
KR: Execute Ω
  |
  v
KR: SE44 Validate (pass)
  |
  v
SV: Recompute (pass)
  |
  v
FL: Integrity Check (FAIL)
  |
  +--------------------+
  |                    |
  v                    |
Client ← REJECTED      |
                       |
MS: (OPTIONAL LOG) ◄───+

What this proves

Even perfect validators cannot override ledger invariants

Append-only enforcement is final authority

No partial writes are possible

🚫 Impossible Transitions (By Construction)

These transitions do not exist in code:

SE44 FAIL → FL WRITE        ❌
SV MISMATCH → FL WRITE     ❌
FL REJECT → HISTORY EDIT   ❌
KR OVERRIDE → ACCEPT       ❌
Structural Guarantee

Failure can only move downward into quarantine,
never sideways into authority,
and never backward into history.
If any of these occur, the kernel is compromised — not “misconfigured”.
