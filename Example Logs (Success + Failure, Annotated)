Example Logs (Success + Failure, Annotated)

These are representative, literal logs a cloner will see when running the demo.
Nothing abstract. Each line corresponds to a real execution step.

You can paste this section directly into the README.

🟢 Successful Governance Execution (Baseline)
Kernel Runtime (kernel-runtime)
[KR][INFO] Received emission request
[KR][DEBUG] State(type=symbolic, hash=7c1e…)
[KR][DEBUG] Bias(version=v1.0.0, hash=91ab…)
[KR][DEBUG] Alpha(domain=demo, value=1.1)

[KR][INFO] Ω computed: 12.1
[KR][INFO] Trace generated
[KR][INFO] SE44 validation started
[KR][INFO] Metrics:
    coherence = 0.997
    entropy   = 0.004
    rms_drift = 0.0003

[KR][INFO] SE44 PASS
[KR][INFO] Forwarding candidate to secondary validator

Secondary Validator (validator-secondary)
[SV][INFO] Received candidate Ω
[SV][INFO] Recomputing Ω independently
[SV][INFO] Ω recomputed: 12.1

[SV][INFO] Metrics recomputed:
    coherence = 0.997
    entropy   = 0.004
    rms_drift = 0.0003

[SV][INFO] Hash match confirmed
[SV][INFO] Consensus achieved

Fossil Ledger (fossil-ledger)
[FL][INFO] Consensus receipt received
[FL][INFO] Canonicalizing JSON
[FL][INFO] Previous hash: a91f…
[FL][INFO] New hash computed: b44e…
[FL][INFO] Appending fossil entry
[FL][INFO] Ledger append successful

Client Response
{
  "status": "ACCEPTED",
  "omega": 12.1,
  "hash": "b44e…"
}


Invariant confirmed:
✔ History advanced exactly once
✔ All components agreed

❌ Failure Case 1: SE44 Entropy Violation
Kernel Runtime
[KR][INFO] Received emission request
[KR][DEBUG] State(type=symbolic, hash=aa02…)
[KR][DEBUG] Bias(version=v1.0.0, hash=91ab…)
[KR][DEBUG] Alpha(domain=demo, value=10.0)

[KR][INFO] Ω computed: 10010.0
[KR][INFO] Trace generated
[KR][INFO] SE44 validation started
[KR][WARN] Metrics:
    coherence = 0.992
    entropy   = 0.087   ← threshold exceeded
    rms_drift = 0.0004

[KR][ERROR] SE44 FAIL: entropy threshold exceeded
[KR][INFO] Writing emission to mutable shell
[KR][INFO] Ledger write skipped

What You Will Not See
[SV] …
[FL] …


They are never called.

Client Response
{
  "status": "REJECTED",
  "reason": "SE44_ENTROPY_VIOLATION"
}


Invariant confirmed:
✔ Ledger unchanged
✔ Failure contained
✔ Experiment preserved

❌ Failure Case 2: Dual Validator Mismatch (SE44.1)
Kernel Runtime
[KR][INFO] Received emission request
[KR][INFO] Ω computed: 6.0
[KR][INFO] SE44 PASS
[KR][INFO] Forwarding candidate to secondary validator

Secondary Validator
[SV][INFO] Recomputing Ω
[SV][INFO] Ω recomputed: 6.5   ← mismatch detected
[SV][ERROR] Hash mismatch
[SV][ERROR] Consensus failed

Kernel Runtime (after validator response)
[KR][ERROR] Secondary validator disagreement
[KR][INFO] Writing emission to mutable shell
[KR][INFO] Ledger write aborted

Fossil Ledger
(no log output)


Ledger is never contacted.

Client Response
{
  "status": "REJECTED",
  "reason": "VALIDATOR_MISMATCH"
}


Invariant confirmed:
✔ No single runtime can assert governance
✔ Consensus failure halts authority

❌ Failure Case 3: Ledger Integrity Refusal
Fossil Ledger
[FL][WARN] Previous hash mismatch detected
[FL][ERROR] Append refused: chain integrity violation

Kernel Runtime
[KR][ERROR] Ledger refusal received
[KR][INFO] Emission rejected

Client Response
{
  "status": "REJECTED",
  "reason": "LEDGER_INTEGRITY_VIOLATION"
}


Invariant confirmed:
✔ Even valid Ω + validators cannot override history

🔒 Log-Level Guarantees

From these logs alone, an auditor can verify:

Where failure occurred

Why it occurred

What was not touched

That history is intact

There are no silent paths.
